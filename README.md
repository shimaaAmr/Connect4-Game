The game allows players to compete against the computer in a game of Connect4, which is a popular strategic game.

In this project, the MiniMax algorithm is used to determine the computer's best choice at each step. The MiniMax algorithm is one of the most well-known algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence and is commonly used in strategic games to make optimal decisions. The algorithm evaluates different game states and deduces the best move the computer can make to achieve a win or the best possible outcome.

Additionally, the project utilizes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to provide an enhanced user playing experience. Players can interact with the game by clicking on the available cells and placing their pieces in the appropriate positions. The current game state and available moves for each player are visually displayed in an attractive and easy-to-understand manner.

Using GitHub, users can download the project, run it, and contribute to it by adding new features or improving the existing code. GitHub facilitates collaboration and participation in the game's development, providing a platform for programmers to learn and exchange knowledge.

Overall, this project aims to provide an enjoyable playing experience while enhancing programming and artificial intelligence skills for participating developers.
